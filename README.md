# Operator Deep Smoothing for Implied Volatility

This repository contains the code for the paper *Operator Deep Smoothing for Implied Volatility* available on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11520).
It contains the import package `op_ds`, which contains code components for *operator deep smoothing*, a general, discretization-invariant data interpolation method based on graph neural operators[^1].
Code components used to produce the results of the paper in the context of implied volatility smoothing reside in the folder `volatility_smoothing`.


## Installation

Simply pip-install from the repository root.
The IPython kernel dependency is included in the pip install extra group `dev`.
